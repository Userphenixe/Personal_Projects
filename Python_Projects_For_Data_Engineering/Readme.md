# Python for Data Engineering

This repository contains Python scripts for performing common data engineering tasks, such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), web scraping, API interaction, and data manipulation. The project uses several libraries to handle data extraction, transformation, and analysis, as well as to interact with web resources and databases.

## Technologies Used

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Processes for extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a target destination like databases or files.
- **Web Scraping**: Using **BeautifulSoup** to extract data from HTML web pages.
- **APIs**: Interacting with third-party APIs to fetch data in formats like JSON or XML.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library used for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used for parsing HTML and XML documents to extract useful data.
- **Requests**: A library to send HTTP requests and retrieve data from web servers.
- **Databases**: Interfacing with relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) to store and manage data.

## Features

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Automate data extraction from files, APIs, and web pages. Transform and clean data for analysis or storage. Load processed data into databases or files.
- **Web Scraping**: Collect data from websites, parse HTML content, and extract structured information using **BeautifulSoup**.
- **API Integration**: Fetch data from various third-party APIs (e.g., weather, financial data) using the **Requests** library.
- **Data Manipulation**: Clean, transform, and analyze large datasets with **Pandas**. Perform operations like filtering, aggregating, and merging data from different sources.
- **Database Interaction**: Insert extracted data into relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) using **SQLAlchemy** and execute SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.
- **Automation**: Scripts can be scheduled or triggered to run automatically at set intervals for continuous data extraction and processing.
- **Logging**: Built-in logging for tracking script execution, errors, and data processing stages.
